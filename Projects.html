                Gesture control and the concept of the Internet of Things, when implemented as a single entity, can undoubtedly revolutionize the way humans interface with various devices. From smart devices at homes to industrial robots, gestures can be used to control a number of devices that are connected together in a network.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                GloveBud is a gesture-enabled glove that can be worn by the user to control various devices connected over a network preferably WiFi. The project aimed at achieving home automation through the GloveBud by Wi-Fi enabling home appliances such as the lights, fans, televisions etc. GloveBud is worn and predefined gestures allow the user to control their appliances.

                India is an agricultural powerhouse with majority of its people relying on agriculture as their major occupation. With the increasing popularity of domains like Virtual Reality and Embedded Systems, we aim to empower the farmers with a system that allows them to monitor their farms virtually. 
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The objective is to provide the farmer with a tool that will give them 3D, computer-generated simulation of the farm while at home. This virtual tour of the farm withdraws the necessity to be physically present at the farm to monitor it. In addition to the virtual tour, the tool provides vital information like moisture level, pH level of the soil and market prices.
